## Overview

Permanently removes a vendor portal user account. This cannot be undone.

### Use Cases

- **Revoke portal access** when a vendor team member leaves
- **Clean up duplicate accounts** created by mistake
- **Offboard vendors** by removing all associated user accounts

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="userId" type="string" required>
  The user's unique ID.
</ParamField>

## Response

```json 200
{
  "message": "User deleted successfully.",
  "user": { ... }
}
```

<Warning>
  This is a permanent deletion, not a soft delete. The user will no longer be able to log into the vendor portal.
</Warning>

## Example

curl -X DELETE "https://api.puppetvendors.com/v1/users/61a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2" \
