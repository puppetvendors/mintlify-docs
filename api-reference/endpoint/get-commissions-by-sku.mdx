## Overview

Returns the SKU-level commission configuration and cost of goods for all SKUs registered in your shop.

### Use Cases

- **Export COGS data** for margin analysis or financial reporting
- **Sync SKU pricing** between PuppetVendors and an external ERP

## Response

```json 200
{
  "skus": [
    {
      "sku": "TSH-LG-BLU",
      "costOfGoods": 15.50,
      "commissionType": "percentage",
      "commissionAmount": 14
    },
    {
      "sku": "MUG-WHT-001",
      "costOfGoods": 3.20,
      "commissionType": "flat",
      "commissionAmount": 2.00
    }
  ]
}
```

<Info>
  SKU-level commissions override vendor-level commissions when both are configured. Cost of goods values are used in payout calculations to determine vendor earnings.
