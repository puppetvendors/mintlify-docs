- **Pull calculated line items** to verify commission and payout amounts
- **Feed order data** into an external accounting or fulfillment system
- **Build a custom order detail page** in a third-party dashboard

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="orderId" type="string" required>
  The Shopify order ID (numeric).
</ParamField>

## Query Parameters

<ParamField query="lineItems" type="string">
  Set to `"true"` to return calculated line items instead of the raw order document. Calculated line items include commission, payout, cost of goods, and other financial fields.
</ParamField>
