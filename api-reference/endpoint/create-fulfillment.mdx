title: Create Fulfillment
description: "Fulfill line items with tracking information"
api: "POST /v1/fulfillments"
---

## Overview

Submit line items for fulfillment with tracking details. This creates a fulfillment in Shopify and updates the line item records in PuppetVendors.

### Use Cases

- **Automate fulfillment** from a third-party warehouse or 3PL system
- **Bulk-fulfill orders** by scripting API calls from a shipping platform
- **Connect non-Shopify fulfillment services** to your multi-vendor workflow

## Request Body

<ParamField body="trackingNumber" type="string" required>
  Shipment tracking number.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="shippingCarrier" type="string" required>
  Shipping carrier name (e.g. `"Royal Mail"`, `"UPS"`, `"FedEx"`).
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="trackingUrl" type="string" required>
  URL for tracking the shipment.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="lineItemsToFulfill" type="array" required>
  Array of calculated line item IDs (PuppetVendors `_id` values) to fulfill.
</ParamField>

## Response

```json 200
{
  "fulfillments": [
    {
      "type": "success",
      "lineItemId": "...",
      "message": "Fulfillment completed successfully."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Partial Failure

If some items fail to fulfill, each item reports individually:

```json 200
{
  "fulfillments": [
    { "type": "success", "lineItemId": "abc...", "message": "Fulfillment completed successfully." },
    { "type": "error", "lineItemId": "def...", "message": "Already fulfilled" }
  ]
}
```

## Example

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.puppetvendors.com/v1/fulfillments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-access-token: YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "trackingNumber": "RM123456789GB",
    "shippingCarrier": "Royal Mail",
    "trackingUrl": "https://tracking.royalmail.com/RM123456789GB",
    "lineItemsToFulfill": ["64a1b2c3d4e5f6...", "64a1b2c3d4e5f7..."]
  }'
```
